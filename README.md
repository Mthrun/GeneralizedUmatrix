## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"/>

Dimensionality Reduction methods are either manifold learning approaches or methods of projection. Projection methods should be prefered if the goal is the visualization of cluster structures [Thrun, 2018]. Two-dimensional projections are visualized as scatter plot. The Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss lemma states that in such a case the low-dimensional similarities does not represent high-dimensional distances coercively (details in [Thrun/Ultsch,2018]. To solve this problem the high-dimensional distances can be visualized in the two-dimensional projection as 3D landscape of a topographic map with hypsometric tints [Thrun, 2018; Ultsch/Thrun, 2017; Thrun et al., 2016].

The GeneralizedUmatrix package allows to
- **Calculate Generalized Umatrix with ESOM:** Calcuation of the Umatrix with emergent self organizing map (ESOM).
- **Visualize Umatrix as 3D landscape:** Visualization of the Umatrix as topographic map with hypsometric tints.

The 3D topographic map of a 2D projection visualizes projection errors, where neighboring projected points in a 2D scatter plot are not similar to each other in the high-dimensional space.
The U-matrix visualizes these errors in a topographic map as landscape, where similar points are represented in a valley, dissimilar points are separated by mountains and thus non-structured/chaotic neighborhoods are represented as hilly area.
The visualization can be used both for the interactive identification of cluster structures by a human user or automatized by taking decisions boundaries based on mountain ridges.


Use a projection method of choice to project the high dimensional data into 2 dimensions. Here cmdscale, a classical MDS algorithm is used.

```{}
data(Chainlink)
Data=Chainlink$Data
Cls=Chainlink$Cls

InputDistances = as.matrix(dist(Data))
model = cmdscale(
  d = InputDistances, k = 2, eig = TRUE, add = FALSE, x.ret = FALSE
)
ProjectedPoints = as.matrix(model$points)
```

Calculate generalized Umatrix
```{}
genUmatrix = GeneralizedUmatrix(Data, ProjectedPoints)
```

Plot topographic map of the Umatrix
```{}
plotTopographicMap(genUmatrix$Umatrix, 
                   genUmatrix$Bestmatches, 
                   NoLevels = 10)
```
